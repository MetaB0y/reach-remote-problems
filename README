This repo demostrates 2 problems with remote calls.

This is my quick and dirty attempt to make minimal example, not very well written and not really so minimal, but should be good enough.

Usage:
1. npm install
2. reach compile
3. REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=ALGO-devnet reach devnet
4. REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=ALGO-devnet node deploy.mjs
